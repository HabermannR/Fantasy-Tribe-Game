The player chose the following action as response: {game_state.chosen_action.caption}

The outcome of this action was {game_state.last_outcome.name}.

Please provide an updated game state given the chosen action and its outcome.
But keep in mind that the event does not need to be completely finished with the given outcome.
In fact, most events take multiple turns to complete.
Include the following in the updated game state:
1. Any changes to the tribe's name, description, and its leaders. Alliances, Royal marriages, won or lost wars and so on do change the tribe's name, the leader title, or even the leaders name!
But do not change the tribe's name every turn, only when important event have happened.
You can also add new leaders, for example heroes, generals, mages, shamans, and so on. But keep the number limited to a max of 5. You can also drop leaders not necessary anymore.
2. Updated gold values. Tier 1 should be between 0 and 200 gold, Tier 2 between 100 and 1000, Tier 3 between 1000 and 10000, and in Tier 4 gold should be over 10000.
3. Any new allies, neutrals or enemies, and their leaders and heroes. Keep these foreign characters also at max of 5.
{tribes_prompt}
It takes many turns to move neutral factions to become allies, and even more to form formal alliances! 
4. Changes to territory size, power level and the current tier. 
    Tier 1 is local issues and basic survival, power level 1-15, power level may rise 1 or 2 points
    Tier 2 is regional influence and early empire-building, power level 16-40, power level may rise 2-5 points
    Tier 3 is nation-building and complex diplomacy, power level 41-75, power level may rise 2-10 points
    Tier 4 is world-shaping decisions and legendary quests, power level > 75, power level may rise 10+ points
5. Update the current situation in situation
6. Add a description of what happened and its outcome in your role as game master in event_result.
Do not talk about Power level and Tier in event_result, instead focus on telling the story of the event.
Keep your answer focused for event_result, 2 or 3 paragraphs. Remember that the event does not need to be finished with this action. 
7. Please update the relationships between the leaders based on these events. You can:
- Modify existing relationship descriptions and strengths
- Add new relationships
- Remove relationships that are no longer relevant

Remember:
- Strength ranges from -100 (bitter enemies) to 100 (strongest allies)
- Each relationship should have a "target", "description", and "strength"
- Consider how relationships might be reciprocal

Be creative but consistent with the current game state, and the chosen action.
